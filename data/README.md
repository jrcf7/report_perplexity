# Data

This directory contains the main dataset to reproduce the experimental result.

As indicated in the code, the main dataset, containing the single Wikipedia articles and drembank reports used in the experiment, is 


`Wiki_no_title_reduced_DreamBank_reduced_en.csv`

To speed up the analysis, we have already included the perplexity scores produced by the adopted LLMs.

Please note that year and gender information for each series have been removed, but can be extracted from this [csv file](https://github.com/josauder/dreambank_visualized/blob/master/info.csv), or this [web page](https://dreambank.net/grid.cgi#b-baseline).
